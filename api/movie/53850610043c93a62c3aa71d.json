Part twisted entertainment, part government intimidation tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which \u201cTributes\u201d must fight with one another until one survivor remains.  Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she\u2019s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.","poster":"poster/themoviedb/the-hunger-games/iLJdwmzrHFjFwI5lvYAT1gcpRuA.jpg","recovery":null,"release":1332460800000,"seen":0,"tagline":"May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor.","title":"The Hunger Games","trailers":null,"videoFiles":[{"file":"/mnt/data/Movies/Sagas/The.Hunger.Games.2012.BDRip.{x264+LC-AAC.5.1}{Fr-Eng}{Sub.Fr-Eng}-\u2122.mkv","hash":null,"multipart":false,"nextParts":[],"quality":null}],"voteAverage":0.6299999952316284}
